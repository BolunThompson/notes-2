Is it a good idea to spend 200k a year on a child on aristocratic tutoring, private schools, etc?
	Max the K reproductive strategy?
	Instead of a private school, maybe it would be better to move to an area with top magnet public schools?
		Like thomas jefferson HS
		Or even just CCA, but is that enough?
		If they can't get in, make sure there's good enough schools anyway in the district
			There probably would be
			Wouldn't hurt their future overall anyways
Am I doing so many things that I'm negelecting or forgetting about somethings?
	Am I even doing a lot of things? Do I have an overly busy life or just a busy one?
Should I do 3rd movie report for lab just in case my lab hours are reduced from being late?
