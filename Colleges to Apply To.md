For 18ish colleges with  9 / 7 / 2 ratio?
: Means LAC probation
! Means state replacement
| Means that I'm not counting it in my 18 college cap, but I might still apply
Colleges (4 x 350 + 650):
	: Around 26 supplementals to write
	High Reach:
		Question: MIT vs CMU -- which to apply to?
			Which am I a better fit for?
			Also could remove other colleges and keep both
				I have been doing that lately
		Caltech (20k a year) (4 x 200)
		Stanford (7k a year) (3 x 50 + 3 x 250)
			REA: 3.7 -> 9.2
				But claims online no REA bonus
		UCB (24k before calgrant)
			I could also apply for M.E.T
				Decision: Yes if I'm have time and is applying for EECS anyways, or I think I have a decent chance
				Still considered for EECS once I'm rejected
				1% acceptance rate
					Even with my ECs, I have like a 15% chance
						I haven't started a startup lol
				U Penn also has a similar program, but I'm not bothering to apply there
			EECS vs L&S CS?
				Decision: EECS if I somehow have a decent chance at MET or it has a higher acceptance rate than L&S CS, other wise L&S CS
				With new direct admit policy, acceptance rate should be about the same
					but if it isn't, the easier one
				Impression is that they're considered to be equal for jobs unless it is hardware related
				Pros of L&S:
					Easier to double major in Math or Economics
					Easier to take more writing/history classes
					More flexible -- doesn't pigeon hole me into hardware
						Helps for non hardware related grad school (ex: ml, plt, anything else)
				Pros of EECS:
					Slightly more prestiogous for school related things
					BS, not BA
					Allows me to get more engineering and hardware experience
						Helps for hardware related grad school (ex: semiconductors)
					Hardware is interesting!
						But perhaps not enough to pigen hole myself
					Requires some hardware classes, but not an absurd amount
					Can do MET
		UCLA (21k before calgrant)
			Major: CS w/ 3.8% acceptance rate
				CSE has a 3.1% and CE has a 3.9%, so it's not worth switching
			Although they expect family contribution to be like 12k, which is higher than FAFSA, so the actual cost could be lower
		CMU (20k)? (3 x 300)
			ED: 13.5 ->19.9
				But claims online that only ~0.5% actual bonus
			Offers ED II
			Is it slightly easier than MIT or Stanford?
		Cornell (17k) (for A&S: 650, for Eng: 2 x 250)
			If I don't ED, should I apply?
				Yes, still has a higher acceptance rate than MIT or stanford
			Question: How much  of the ED bonus is real versus from legacy and sports admits?
			ED: 7.2 -> 19.2
				But how about for Eng or A&S?
			Reg CS in Eng: 6.1%
			Reg CS in A&S: 5.7% 
			Major: CS in A&S bc I prefer the essays and the liberal arts reqs
			High ED acceptance rate relatively , maybe 10% 
				Ofc rd rate would be lower than 7.2 bc harder college
				Acutally 19%, but I cut it in half bc harder college and not a sports admit
			Not my favorite high reach -- should I hedge my bets and ED?
				I would still go there over all my low reaches (accept maaybe olin)
			    how is it compared to other low and top reaches?
			        (maybe not mit, stanford bc i have a very low chance of getting in there?)
			        for reserach and for industry?
			        size?
			            easy undergrad research opportunities?
			    am I a good fit for the school?
		(MIT (11k) (250 x 4 + 100)?)
			Maybe only apply if summer research goes really well?
			Is this too competitive to bother?
				Although some people on /r/collegeresults did manage to get in with ECs and stats like mine
					But many others got rejected
			Comparing ECs, what is expected for CS majors?
				Are mine good?
				Ofc for others, research looks good, but that's harder for a cs major
			EA: 4.7 -> 5.7
				No EA bonus
	Low Reach
		UCSD
			What college?
		Olin (16k) (500)
			Pro: Good grad school placement rate apparently, good job prospects apparently
			Con: Low acceptance rate
			Probably apply Engineering: Computing
				Despite being an engineering school, seems to have a decent CS program
		Georgia Tech (after average merit 29k a year) (300)?
			A bit expensive
			13% acceptance rate oos (maybe real number lower bc it only has beter applicants)
				I think it's the same for CS
					Major is accounted for, but not capped
			EA for merit scholarships
	High Target:
		UCI
			Major: CS
				It might be easier to get in as CSE, but no data is given and it might be medium hard to transfer (I might be in the engineering school and I would have to transfer to the CS school)
		UCSB
			Major: CS
				CE exists, but I can't tell if it has a higher acceptance rate
		CSU SLO (23k a year - calgrant)
			Major: CSE
			Is this a high target? It almost seems random
				Could honestly be a reach or a low target
				Seems like a high target with my SLO GPA, but that could be off
			Weird classes -- they want 5 yr english and 2 yr fine arts
				I'm not going to meet them, and it isn't a reqrueiment, but makes it a high target
				May not effect score bc, accoring to the old MCA calculator, I already maxed out my rigor bonus
			According to old MCA calc, I have 4838, which is competitive
			3% yield rate, maybe 7% acceptance CS rate?
			Maybe apply as computer engineering or software engineering to increase acceptance rate?
				Probably CSE (unless they want me to describe my ECs) bc highest predicted admit rate between CS, CSE, and SE 
					see https://content-calpoly-edu.s3.amazonaws.com/ir/1/images/Enrollment%20Projections_2023-24.pdf
				See https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/kddtgf/cal_poly_slo_cs_acceptance_rate/
			Literally a small engineering school with the costs and benefits of one
				Less research, but easier for undergraduates to do available research
					https://mckoder.medium.com/why-choose-cal-poly-for-computer-science-e620b9ce588d
				Standard contrast lol
			Ranking:
				Better than UCD and below
				Worse than UCSD and above
				Comparable to UCI or UCSB but undergraduate engineering, not research, focused
			How can I generously present myself to increase my odds?
				Calculate optimistic EC hrs per week number
				Make sure to include MS and CC classes
					And HPE CC course too, ig, although it most likely wouldn't matter since I most likely hit the honors cap
						Maybe unnecessary if it is already considered an a-g course
		(UVA(18k) (250 + 100)?)
			EA: 8% -> 12%
				Maybe EA or don't bother?
			They don't cap majors!
			Okay CS program --  is it worth dealing with 12% uncapped acceptance rate?
				But maybe it's decent? 29 us news -- like uc davis
					For context, UCI is 9.1% for CS
				Maybe I should just apply to UNC Chapel Hill instead?
					Nah -- this is cheaper, slightly higher acceptance rate, and less supplementals
				Maybe perdue instead?
	Low Target
		UC Davis
			Probably better than UCSC, but it's close
	High Safety?:
		QUESTION: Should I just go to cc?
		UC Santa Cruz (20.5k - 23.5 k before calgrant)
		UCR
	Low Safety
		| UC Merced
			Should I apply? Leaning toward no rn.
				Pro:
					Guarenteed safety
				Con:
					$70
					Most likely I would be auto admitted or allowed to apply late
					I'll probably get into a better school
						Even if they run out of auto admit spots -- which they probably won't -- I would be a better canidate for auto admission
					Might rather just go to CC instead
			Has its own flavor of big school vs small school debate
				medium sized college so it's easier to do undergraduate research and get LoRs, but it also has less research opportunities
					number 6 on csranking for hpc (5 is ucr, best in uc system) though lol
			Not that bad -- it is t100 and a UC (and, ya' know, wasc accreditted)
			Should I go to UC Merced if I accepted a UCR or similar math major?
				No bc I would go to cc and try to transfer
			19 k a year
			But the location (central valley!) sucks
				But it does have new equipment
			vs SDSU
				UCM better for research
				For jobs, ?
				: Granted, probably not a decision I will make
		| Community College
Ones I could add to tilt the colleges:
	: Add these if I'm dissatisfied with one of my choices
	LAC
		! Harvey Mudd (500 + 100)
			21k a year (before calgrant)
			Is it more like a Small Engineering school?
				That is: LAC-like research and grad school results but also good job placement, 
			10% acceptance rate
				Downweighted bc it is more obscure?
				But 21% ed acceptance rate and ED II eligible -- maybe apply for ed II?
					Or even ED I
					Is there an ed acceptance rate difference between ED I and II?
			Maybe I should just apply? Am I biased against it from my dad?
			Male bias though
			Are they a feeder to t10 grad schools?
		! Carleton (19k)?
			At a glance looks to have legit accredidation
			No application fee
			Does it have worse job outcomes than non LACs?
			It probably doesn't have a anti-male bias
			Probably a high target or a low reach
			Is it actually good for CS PhD into top programs?
				According to [one random guy on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarletonCollege/comments/u3wor9/more_questions_about_computer_science_whats_the/i4vnj0k/) it isnt…
		Welessley bc 10k a year but 16% acceptance rate
		Swathemore (12k a year) (highest PhD rank for CS LAC) (250 x 1)
			Question: Is it good for going to top cs grad schools?
			Low or high reach?
			Get rid of UVA for it lol?
			but 9% acceptance rate, although need blind and (maybe?) no male bias
			Does it send students to top grad schools?
			https://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid/discover-swarthmore-fly-program
		Oberlin bc 16k a year and high phd rank
			 Can 3/2 with Caltech
		Bucknell?
			6 US News undergraduate engineering no-graduate ranking
			25k a year?
			decent-ish cs program?
				Better than Macalester?
		| Wesleyan?
			Process:
				No Suppementals!
				No application fee! (with applying for financial aid)
				No demonstrated interest!
				Only hassle is a (highly reccomended) alumni interview
					On the other hand, I am very busy -- should I bother?
			At a glance looks to have legit accredidation
			Probably has a good CS program
			10k a year
			16% acceptance rate
				Should I just apply to harvey-mudd?
				Probably higher than it seems bc it has no fee or essays
			Offers caltech 3/2 program
			[Apparently gives a small advantage to men](https://hechingerreport.org/an-unnoticed-result-of-the-decline-of-men-in-college-its-harder-for-women-to-get-in/)
				And that's why to apply to it instead of HMC
			Fly-in program: https://www.wesleyan.edu/admission/visit-connect/wesexplore.html
				Not white so maybe I can get in?
			Need aware
			Are they a feeder to t10 grad schools?
		Macalester?
			20k a year with 30% acceptance rate
			at a glance seems like a decent-ish cs program (like uc davis ish?)
			however, need aware (but no cs tax)
			Competitive with Bucknell?
			Actually has a qb team!
			Good for international studies -- maybe bokei should apply if she's interested in the field?
	Small Engineering
		Cooper Union (21k) (3 x 250)
			Is it a good fit for me bc less CS focus?
				TODO: Email alumni who went into cs asking about it
					Would he reccomend it?
				On the other hand, I could just go into CE
			Probably apply EE intending to go down the CE track
				Do a very CS orientated CE track
				Alternative: General Engineering major and take as many CS clases as possible
					Maybe I could switch into the major after my first year if I think it's better?
				TODO: Email Cooper Union admissions office to ask about whether I should apply as EE for CE or GE with CS
			Quick impression is that it would be best to go into CE, not CS
				Only apply if CE is still on the table for me
					Do I like it? I might, but I've never tried it.
	Medium Private
		Case Western (21k)
			Hesitantly not applying
			Quality:
				Research: Worse than UCM
				Industry: A little better than UCM? But not in CA
			30% acceptance rate w/ no CS tax
				However, it is need aware
			unknown CS program quality but can't be too bad
			Decent, but not top ranked, for AI
				According to reddit comment
				TODO: Check CS Rankings to confirm this is true
					ie: determin whether it's better than low ranking UCs
			Is its research actually good? Low-ish csrank
				Granted, it's a small -- but still research! -- college
			I think better than UCSC, UCR, and UCD (ignoring location), but worse than other UCs
			According to US News *general* rankings: a little worse than UCD but better than UCSC, UCR, UCM
			Idea: apply to https://case.edu/admission/diversity-overnight to demonstrate interest
			Is Case Western Reserve actually around the level of UC Davis?
				Or is it like UCSC? Or worse?
					According to CS Rank, it is a lot worse than UC Merced (62 vs 100() while only being about 10% smaller
					According to US News, CWRU is 64 while UC Merced isn't ranked
						Is that a bad sign? Or just random chance?
			TODO: To determine whether I should apply, look at the faculty and see if they have decent faculty in areas i'm interested in
				Maybe compare with UCM and, if worse, don't apply??
	Large States
		! UNC Chapel Hill
			23k a year
			8% acceptance rate oos
			Have to compete to get into CS program -- i think i can do it
			CS understaffed last few years, but getting better
	Super Competitive Privates
		John Hopkins (16k)
			9.2% acceptance rate -- like cornell but just worse for CS?
		(harvard / princeton / columbia)
Next Steps:
	Switch all college emails to me@bolun.dev
	Figure out, of my potential high reaches, which I have the best chance to get in to (ie: that I have the best fit for) and apply to those
		Ask in Chance me?
	Should I apply to more Low Reach schools?
	Should I TA for (and thus get a LoR from) Mrs. Montgomery or Mr. Hawken?
		Pro Mr. Hawken:
			Junior Year
			Year Long
			Top in class
		Pro Ms. Montegomery
			Talked to her about NSLI-Y and Hero's Journey presentation
			Maybe a better writer?
				Although Mr. Hawken did pass a history major
		TODO:
			Ask people about his LoR -- do you fill out a form to detail yourself?
				Which do they think I should pick
			Which teachers have given me "good to be in class"?
				Is it relavant?
				Do they give it to all students?
			If Ms. Montgomery: Ask about if I could TA
				If not, don't do it
			Choose
		Is it bad to get a LoR from a Sophomore teacher?
			According to https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/asking-for-letters-of-recommendation-during-a-pandemic/, for MIT, it isn't necessary (they just need to know you)
		On the other hand, I do know Mrs. Montgomery better and I could TA for her
		(also do this if TA for Mrs. Montgomery?) https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vRPHmiBaHbvqj7V_As_kxpYmt7tddo0Sozz4d9Z3azk/edit
	Make sure I fit at all the schools I'm applying to
		Swap colleges based upon fit
		Also to write good "Why School" essays and to show demonstrated interest
		Watch youtube videos, go to zoom seminars, etc
			Consistently use Aaron Thompson
				Does common app even know Bolun Thompson?
		What college admissions visits will our school and area offer?
		Determine whether I should switch my "?" schools with other schools
			Or if I should get rid of them if I'm applying to too many
		: LAC plan: not apply to any(more), but switch them out with current schools if I don't like one
Early List:
	Assuming that I don't run a big-ass hackathon after ed before rd bc that would make me a more competitive rd applicant
	ED I : Cornell if I like the school, otherwise it doesn't matter
			TODO: Ask on /r/chanceme if my odds are good enough to hedge
				And/or look at mom's supposed convo with a guidance counselor about if my oods are good for caltech, mit,, ucb
				Ig maybe I should just follow my parents' advice and not -- idk also
		I would be hedging my bets -- probably worth it, i don't think my odds at caltech/mit/stanford are good enough to not hedge
			Cornell is a very good school 
		EA: GT, UVA? (don't say whether they provide a bonus),
		Also MIT but no bonus provided
	ED II : CMU??
		Very small ED II bonus, but I would love to go there
			But maybe not for flexibility?
				What if more expensive than NPC? Although I could appeal
			But also UCB, Stanford, Caltech
		If I want a LAC, carleton or HMC
		Only do if it's my best or equal with my other low reaches
		TODO: Make sure it is the hardestr ed ii school with best ed bonus
Takeaways:
	ASU maybe w/ barrett college?
		seems perhaps better than merced or riverside/santa cruz but worse than anything else
		ASU is big college vs others are small collges -- less research opportunities?
	US News is weird -- ranks u of arizona as better than case western, for instance
		For looking at colleges use phd list?
	OOS colleges have mediocre to non existent fin aid packages
	UIUC OOS is only 40k a year -- much better than certain privates
		Probably still can't affort it though
		G Tech is 33k!
	Parent money sources:
		100k+ in ira
		4k per year in college from tax credits
		13k in calgrant for UC -- but UCs may reduce aid from it
	(with 12 colleges) priority for new colleges wold be high target → high safety → high reach (and no new low safeties)
		Maybe UUIC, Georgia Tech, U of Utah, and CMU
			Only U of Utah if it is same price as UCSC?, so probably not
			Can I afford UIUC (and georgia tech for that matter)
				Between UUIC and Georgia Tech and other similar OOS, maybe just pick the cheapest
	UIUC and U Mich would both be very expensive -- idk which would be better
	Look at affirmative action -- bias against those colleges?
	Cooper Union has no CS program but decent EE program that I can specialize into CS
		Has Computer Engineering EE track
		Can get a CS and Math minor
	For LACs vs OOS State:
		Top: LACs are cheaper
		Mid (like 50% ish): About the same
		Low: IDK
	Prioritize LACs for grad school?
		LACs (esp. lower ranking ones) and maybe some engineering schools pigeon hole me into grad school bc that's there comparative advantage
		Like how non-SLO CSUs pigeon hole me into software engineering
	Eibeck's opinion:
		small colleges don't matter that much -- you won't get lost in a large college
		granted, very large colleges are bad too bc no questions and 300 students per class
		Think about climate from SAD
	Why do I like LOCs and small engineering schools?
		Small colleges which have more professor attention
	For honors colleges: apply to them when I apply, but don't take into account when chooosing colleges to apply to
	Olin CDS indicates that they do, in fact, care about your extracurriculars
		granted, they seem to care about everything on that section
	Max prices:
		Safeties: 25k a year
		Targets: 30k a year? Maybe a bit more
		Reach: 37k a year? Maybe a bit less
	Don't apply to small colleges as safeties
		I don't think they have a good enough grad school pipeline to make it worth the lack of recruiting
	Masters (i think) are only worth it immeadiately after bachelors if:
		1. I'm going into a more specialized field (ex: ml, robotics)
			Maybe try to do undergraduate/masters research along with this If I go this route
		2. I can get an accelerated masters degree (either 4+1 or integrated 4)
		3. I don't want to get a PhD
		Asked Dad: he didn't have a opinion on 4+1 programs
	Suggest Bokei apply to Maclester bc of internationalism focus?
		Is it good for international relations?
	UCs 2nd choice major consideration:
		UCB, for both L&S majors
			They might review you for your second choice major if it isn't capped
				The policy is unclear bc they are now admitted by major for capped majors
			You'll probably get first pickings of waitlist acceptances for your second choice major
			For Engineering majors, they would not review your second choice major probably
				You would still could get waitlist acceptances for 2nd choice, however
		UCD
			"Occasionally, UCD admits to the alternate major"
			It might disadvantage me a little
				Might be more since I'm very CS focused?
		UCLA
			Only considers first choice major, typically
		UCSC
			Might consider second choice major -- doensn't say online
		The rest don't consider major during admission to the university
	Competitiveness:
		Competitive for all, but ucla, ucb are high reaches
		Stats are competitve for top UCs, see: https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/t/chance-my-son-rising-senior-to-caltech-stanford-ucs-cal-poly-slo-cs-or-me/3615436
	GPAs (calculated https://rogerhub.com/gpa-calculator-uc/)
		TODO: Make sure this is correct
			Ask counselors or classmates about specific quarter vs semester?
			Listen to college app seminar for RBHS students?
		Assuming no summer before senior year classes and freshman & senior year doesn't count
		UC Capped: 4.26
		UC Uncapped 4.65
		SLO Capped: 4.17
			Seems low but could be reduced by the heavy number of courses I took
	Idea: Take a shot of vodka everytime I get rejected from college lololol
	You can get a PhD in a practical field like Civil Engineering -- therefore, an engineering college could help you go on to graduate school bc it gives you a practical degree
	College compares:
		Cooper Union < SLO < Olin (hesitantly)
	New Calgrant and MCS Notes:
		Under new system, we would not get a calgrant
		MCS would provide us around 5200 with current funding levels, so around 20000 if fully funded
			Of course, the UC system would reduce their own grants as MCS increases so it *might* cap out with us paying around 14k year for college with fully funded MCS
				Maybe 12k if we're living at home?
				Very rough numbers!
	Fall semester next year ideally i would TA and take both a chinese and math CC class
		Discrete Math <- Linear Algebra <- Multivariable
		Look at Saddleback and Palomar
			See if Saddleback offers better math classes than above (probably won't)
	Interestingly, for "Space Science" the UC ranking is UCB <- UCSC <- other UCs according to US News
	To confirm, I do very much surpass the UC admission guarentee GPA requirement with 4.26 GPA
		This is regardless of how many classes I actrually took -- I surpassed it for all
		https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/freshman-requirements/california-residents/statewide-guarantee/admissions-index-instructions.html
	Undergraduate reseach is useful for grad school and going into specific industry fields (ex: computer vision research)
		Specific industry fields is like getting a masters lol
	At a glance, the only school which has no essays, demonstrated interest or application fee and is affordable is Wesleyan
	(4/24/23) My list is mostly finalized rn until I look into schools in depth
	What to put on additional info section:
		Look [here](https://www.shemmassianconsulting.com/blog/common-app-additional-information-section#what-to-include) ?
		Explain ECs more in depth if I run out of space and it feels right
			OSD maybe?
		Extra AP Scores if necessary
		Awards / Honors if I run out of space, need more explanation, or there's something weird going on with that section?
	Waitlists aren't usually ranked -- I don't think any of the colleges I'm applying to do
	I'm not sure if I want to apply to cooper union since it's so engineeringy
		I want a more liberal artsy education
		I want a more research based education?
			Maybe CU could do this
Questions:
	Is Cooper Union actually good for electrical engineering / computer engineering?
	Should I ask Matt Turk for an additional letter of reccomendatio?
		Yes, probably, if the internship goes well
			Especially if I continue working for him after the summer
		I would have known him long enough for it to be decent, I think
	Should I add more low reaches?
		No, bc I don't know which ones to add
	Does perdue actually have half decent fin aid?
		John chang seems to be satisified
			He got enough merit aid (20k-30k) so it's only a bit more expensive than the UCs
	Is Olin and Cooper union actually good for CS pHd?
		Do they help students go to proper CS grad schools or just engineering majors go to masters programs?
			Maybe I should just ask?
		High in PhD rank, so probably
		Some go to prestigous grad schools according to both websites website
	Are my science classes good enough for top engineering colleges like olin?
		Probably -- ap chem, ap physics c, biology, e&m, ap CS
		Olin doesn't state college requirements, so probably good enough
	Which colleges I'm applying to have interviews?
		For optional interviews, do I have to schedule them myself?
	Are the colleges I'm looking at actually a good fit for me?
		Especially olin
		How liberal arts is Carlton? Would taking non CS classes annoy me?
	Decent Big school or top student at average LOC?
	Do LOCs generally hit above their rank for grad school?
	how much debt should I take on for a good degree?
	Should I take an additional CC math class Spring semester next year?
	    different types of debt -- of what interest rate?
	    does it depend on the school?
	        but what about low paying PhD delay (and worse for small chance, middle paying academia?)
	    Honestly, no or very little just bc I'm finding good deals
	is student debt interest and repayments paused during PhD?S
		Repayments yes -- interest, no
	What is actually my EFC? What are the estimated payments for colleges after i pay?
		According to my dad it's around 7500
	For job prospects and career: CS vs Math degree?
		For my spike, CS is better though
			Maybe similar CS Math odds if the school admits only by major?
	What are my honest chances?
	Check Cooper Union common data set for value of different parts of app
		They don't do cds
	Get on cooper union mailing list and off of reed
		Done
	How much shoud I discount olin, carleton, and cooper union for being obscure colleges only better students would apply to?
	Is small school vs big school (ie: liberal arts college) better for me? !
		LOC vs Big school ratio?
	Should I apply to any target non-engineering LOCs
		Leaning on no rn
		Are the potentially better grad school prospects worth the weaker recruiting?
		Do they have a good CS program?
		Ex: Maclester, Bucknell
	Is Cooper Union truly a good feeder for PhD?
		Is industry better for them?
			Are they a good CS industry feeder? Is that only for PhD? Is their CS worse than they seem?
		Probably? As best as I can tell without asking them
	Should I tailor what I do over the summer for certain colleges?
		Intuitively not worth it
	If I want to go to economics PhD is Cooper Union Math w/ econ minor good?
		CS minor as well?
	At Cooper Union (or any ee required school) how many ee classes do I have to take?
		A couple, mainly freshman year -- not overwhelming
	Can I get a 4+1 masters at cooper union? Should I if I go?
		Can get a masters during my undergraduate (no extra time) if I slave at extra classes -- i might, is it good for grad school or cs?
		Standard masters answer (see below)
	Are 3/2 programs interesting?
		Answer: Probably no -- not worth the extra year
		Pro: More research experience, easier path into prestiguous engineering college
		Con: Extra year costs money and opportunity, less opportunities for internships and recruiting at engineering college (only two years)
		See https://www.admissions.caltech.edu/apply/32-program
		Is the Caltech 3/2 acceptance rate good?
		Job overall: Better than LAC, worse than big school
		Research: Mixture of LAC and big school, assuming continity doesn't matter, probably good?
	Which of these colleges have a quizbowl team? !
		I think it's the top UCs, top privates, and the LACs
			And Case Western ig
		I could start a qb team lol
		If reach: Yes
		If target: Yes, mostly
		If safety: No
	Is cooper union actually UC Irvine level for CS? Is it better? Is it worse?
	UNC Chapel Hill vs UVA CS?
		At a glance, UNC has a slightly better program but UVA has better tuition, fewer supplemetnals, and slightly easier to get in
			Leaning towards the second
		What about acceptance rate comparison?
	Is my ratio right?
		Reasonable, but perhaps weighted too much towards high reaches
			On the other hand, /r/chanceme didn't see anything wrong with it
	Is my number of colleges right?
		Arguably high or low, but not completely out of range
	Is this true:  the compartive advantage of LOCs drop faster than that of state schools
		ie: (relatively) okay LOCs are bad for jobs and okay for grad school, okay state schools are decent for jobs and a little worse for grad school
	How hard are obscure schools (ex: carleton, olin, cooper union) to get into?
		Do only better students apply?
		If I have to raise them up a level: get rid of olin bc too many hard colleges?
	Will not taking AP Bio hurt my chances are top engineering schools?
	Should I take harder classes next year?
		Probably not -- the only worthwhile rigor change is maaybe apes instead of psych
		off rolls allows coach ec, ta allows better rec, taking ap stats is good for math
			changes aren't worth it	
	Should I take more CC classes next year?
	Is Olin better for CS/SE or Computer Engineering?
	Why am I getting decenet fin aid?
		Probably bc bokei and i are going at the same time
	Is U of Utah and ASU Barrett worth applying for? Are they better than low ranked UCs?
		Answer: No bc bad fin aid
		What would the fin aid be like?
	UCLA vs UCSD CS? (out of curiousity ofc)
	Are 3+2 lac programs interesting?
	Calgrant amount
	What colleges want demonstrated interest?
		Olin
		Cooper Union
		Case Western
	Who to TA/get LoR from for next year?
		Mr. Hawken? Junior year teacher & doesn't dislike me
			Not sure about LoR quality though...
		I think sophomore year LoRs are worse, but I would have to check
	Within categories, what is the priority of various schools?
	Should I adjust my targets or reaches based on CS accept rates?
		https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/t/uc-computer-science-admit-rates/3618753
		On the other hand, a lot of unqualified applicants apply, so it's lowered
	What should be my second choice major?
		Applied Math vs Statistics (when it isn't impacted) vs Data Science (when it isn't impacted)
			What job options would applied math or statistics give me?
			Probably lead me into a math heavy swe, ml, actuary, or data science career
				Also grad school in applied math or economics
	How nice are honors programs?
		Probably depends on school -- look at it if I get in lol
	How good are LACs? At what point should I apply?
		Also how good are small engineering colleges?
	Do I now have too many reaches?
		Probably not bc of how many high targets I have and low number of safeties
	What is the precise UC application process? Readers, order, etc
	Do Cooper Union and Olin make good money after graduation / have good recruiting?
		Olin, yes: https://www.olin.edu/articles/olin-college-tops-new-list-colleges-earnings
		I think, but I should double check
	Other than AP and CC classes, what honor courses have I taken?
		I think the rule is that if it's joint with an AP class, it is not, but if it's independent (like HPE), it is?
	Is SJSU good for research?
		Worse research -- like a LAC or SE
		A little more opportunities than Big College, but less than LAC or SE
			Impression online vs UCSC is that UCSC has better research
	Is UVA worth it with 12% OOS acceptance rate?
	Is the ratio right?
	Am I applying to too many or too few colleges?
	What are the rules of Palomar Promise? Would I always be eligible?
	Are top colleges considered good bc they're selective, or are they just selective bc they're good and popular and get too many applicants?
		Could top colleges budgets be increased so they have more spots but still be top?
	Small Engineerin vs LAC vs Big college
		: There's also Large Engineering schools, but I'm not applying to any rn
		: Assuming places like MIT and Caltech have so many opportunities they're like a big college
		: There's also relative acceptance rates -- engineering colleges or LACs often have higher acceptance rates for their prestige
			Main reason I'm choosing to apply to Olin and Cooper Union lol
			But really? Is it just bc only good students apply?
			TODO: Check the GPAs and ECs of Olin and CU applicants from CC to judge this
				But are CC GPAs accurate bc different schools?
		BC
			Good reserach going on
				If very good, get involved in notable research for grad schoolS
			Can be harder to get involved in research bc graduate focus
			Lots of recruiting (relative to prestige)
			Mixture between theory and practical, depending on school, but generally more theoretical
		SE
			Lots of recruiting (relative to school size and prestige)
			Less research going on but easier to get involved in what happens
			Easier to get to know your professors for grad school admissions
			Practical oriented -- worse for theoretical grad school
			Other than SLO, more engineering, not CS, focused
		LAC
			Little recruiting (except harvey mudd, probably)
			Less research going on but easier to get involved in what happens
			Easier to get to know your professors for grad school admissions
			Theory oriented -- worse for practical industry
		Jobs: BC / SLO < SE? (+ HMC) << LAC
			SE is lower only for CS -- TODO: double check if it's actually worse
		Research: BC < SE / LAC (on practical vs theoretical)
			Depends on risk vs reward calculation
	Are my stats good?
		SAT: Yes
		TODO: Compare course rigor and GPA with classmates and what college they got into
		TODO: Compare GPA (weighted or capped weighted, depending on what is provided) with admit GPA
			Am I past the point of dimenishing returns?
	From a rigor perspective, should I switch to APES from AP Psych?
		Largely by default, keep in AP Psych
		Rigor: Either
		Interest: Psych
		Difficulty: Psyhc
		AP Credit: Both, maybe slightly towards APES for UCSD
		A-g: Psych is elective, APES is science -- but I meet my reqs already
	Comparing all the factors, LAC vs Engineering School vs Big college for Grad school?
	Am I doing demonstrated interest right?
		Is it just opening the emails, going to events, and emailing them?
		w/ CU and Olin
		Am I indicating that I'm the same person with the same email address and stuff?
			Granted, Common App is using me@bolun.dev correctly rn
		Example:
			For some schools, that’s exactly how they track demonstrated interest…examples that some schools use: whether emails are opened, if links in the emails are clicked and how long spent wherever on the website the link takes you, attending virtual and/or in person sessions, number of miles traveled to visit in person, applying ED (the ultimate expression of demonstrated interest). There are more examples, but that’s a good start.	
	How much time should I spend on each essay?
		At what point am I done editting an essay?
			1 week of writing plus anther editing week (w/ other essays)?
		Therefore, how many supplementals do I have time to write? How many schools should I apply to?
	How much research is going on at slo, CU, and Olin?
		Something -- i've heard about it being done in all
	CC Vs UC Merced
		CC and transfer
	UCR, UCSC vs CC
		Hesitantly UCR or UCSC
	Is University of Utah merit aid good?
		Double check bc according to cc person it is decent
		(doubt it is, though)
	What is my ranking of UC campuses (as in their quality)?
	What schools take Letters of Reccomendations (LoR) from non-teachers (ie: Mike Norman)?
	Should I get a PhD?
		ofc very early but interesting to think about
		Probably depends on specific sub field
		Is it necessary for "working on hard problems" that interest me?
			Maybe? But a bachelors and going into industry may work instaed
		Maybe best to go into industry for a year or two then get a PhD?
			To get money and industry experience in an interesting field
		I would be sacrificing pay
		Is it necessary for industry research?
			Initial impression, could be wrong: No, but it is very helpful
				Alternative is bachelors or masters
	Figure out if I can TA for Mr. Hawken instead of off-roll
		Answer: I probably can't
		Take AP Bio instead of Psych and now extra TA semester
		CC complaint is that OP is only taking 4 accademic classes junior year, but even with max TA i'm taking 5 academic + 2 CC classes
			Only other potential problem is that I normally take 8 at RBHS
		If I do current schedule instead, take an extra CC class the semester I'm TAing
			Maybe for the SLO rigor lol (although I might have capped it out already)
	Of the big colleges, which schools are best for undergraduate research from an accessibility perspective?
		Is it just inverse corrolated with size?
		According to UCSC marketing they're good at undergraduate research -- is that true compared to other UCs?
			https://admissions.ucsc.edu/majors-academics
	Figure out whther to apply to LACs:
		Answer as of rn: Unknowable, stay the course with my current list but add them as extras if needed
		But maybe I'm a good fit for LACs and therefore can get into a better LAC than other university?
			I have a lot of interests, mostly stem but some liberal artsy
			I've taken a wide variety of courses, both stem and liberal arts
		Big question: Can I get exposure to cutting edge fields and do relavant research in them?
			Do they have good researchers for those fields?
			I can't work with world-known professors, though, at a LAC (although instead at big publics I only have a small chance)
			If yes: probably apply
			If no: maybe apply? Lean on no.
		Honestly, seems unknowable
TODO:
	Are there any good fly-in programs to apply to?
		Can I get into them?
		Use them as college app practice?
	Dw in person college ao? visits
	If I figure out my career interest, apply to colleges based upon that
		TODO: Figure out if I would be interested in making HPC a career
			TODO: Figure out how I could figure this out
			My first thought is that, while it sounds technically interesting, it seems otherwise dull
				Am I actually doing something with it? Making a difference?
			Or figure out if I would like to my computational physics/astronomy research a career
				Like Matt Turk's job
			I could read [Eijkhout's](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-High-Performance-Scientific-Computing/dp/1257992546) book, but according to a review it's a graduate level text
		For HPC: Apply to U of Utah, NC State if I could afford it
			TODO: Figure out best undergraduate universities for going into HPC (research and industry)
			Maybe Ohio State, Perdue, U of Chicago, Virginia tech, and Illinois Institute of Tech
				Lower ranked that UC Merced in HPC apparently though according to CS Rank
			Maybe look at universities with attached super computer centers?
			According to a random guy on reddit: GT, VT, UMD College Park, UVA, Penn State
	Demonstrate interest to Olin and Cooper Union
		Email CU about major
		Chat with CU student rep
		Actually do all of this with Olin
	(June) Ask counselor about when my ta period is, and Mrs. Montegomery about when her normal english period is
		1 / 3 chance its last period so I can't do normal english
			If normal english is impossible, could I do Honors Humanities?
			Could TA last period but leave early to coach some/all mondays?
				Ask counselor about this if it comes to this
		2 / 3 chance its either good or I have to move around my other classes to accomadate TAing
		Ask to move schedule around if they don't line up
			Swap classes with APES if necessary lol
		If I can't do this:
			replace psych and TA period with AP Bio?
				Should I keep Calc III at the CC if I do this?
				Could I do this start of next year if I can't figure it out end of this year?
					Could I even do it easily end of year?
			TA and LoR from Mr. Hawken?
			?
	Look for and schedule admission events

		Downweighted bc obscure and prestigous
Limited Review Removals:
	Bates
