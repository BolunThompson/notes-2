Sponsor changes:
    Use optimized short email
    Follow up another member if no reply
    Use google sheets to keep track and a template to make emails
        Chat GPT to personalization
    Email companies which have already sponsored
    Try to personalize emails a bit more w/ chatgpt
    don't bother w/ linkedin networking, ig
	    Unless i'm aleady connected
Sponsor finding:
	Looked through first page of builtin.com for san diego
Questions:
	Should the generated pitch be targeted more toward the company?
	Should I email a different person instead of marketing lead?
		Like this: 
			> Different companies have different names depending, also at small companies often finding someone with  a founder or chief role helps. Otherwise, Community Engagement Manager, Community Developer, Site Program Manager, & Program Manager are often job titles for the right folks.
		At smaller companies, I've been trying the CTO or similar -- is this right?
	What types of companies donate?
		Unicorn startups maybe?

TODO:
	Finish hunter.io, web scraping script to find email from company url?
		Post on hackathon-organizers ("Bolun's cool hackathon scripts?")?
	Setup every week review of emails to optimize quality?
		A/B test?
	Setup google app script for my email
	Setup email forwarding

Today we're going to be writing cold emails to companies to invite them to sponsor Hack the Wave, a hackathon for high school students in San Diego. Use the template and example pitch to guide what you write. Write a brief "[PITCH]" paragraph in the email, explaining why they should sponsor our event. Here are some very important additional instructions you must follow:
- Most importantly, the hackathon will not help introduce attendees to the company's technology or their industry, so do not mention that. However, consider mentioning that some students might build a project about what the company does.
- You must limit your response to 65 words or less.
- Focus on how partcipants will be building awesome (not innovative) projects.
- Do not argue that the company's sponsorship will increase the credibility of the event or inspire participants.
- Don't write any part of the email other than the "[PITCH]" paragraph
- Try to make the email sound like it's from a modest high school student running a medium sized event. Do not use grandiose statements like "nurture the next generation" or "play a crucial role." Do not claim that this will make every teenager in San Diego love coding. 
- Qualify your statements. Use can, not will.
- Use specific statements. For example, say "develop their skills in technology" instead of just "develop their skills."
- Avoid using the phrases "apps, games, and websites", "young minds," and "opportunity."
- Do not state that it will help the company show their commitment to the community, future generations, young talent, or anything similar.

TEMPLATE:

Dear {Name},

I'm Bolun, a high school junior from San Diego. A few friends and I are organizing Hack the Wave, an overnight hackathon where students aged 13–18 will form teams to build cool apps, games, and websites! I was wondering if {Company} would like to sponsor our event.

(Like this! The picture is from a hackathon in San Francisco)

I've attached a PDF with information about sponsorship benefits (your logo on our website & t-shirts, etc). Sandy Hacks is fiscally sponsored by The Hack Foundation, so we operate as a 501(C)(3) non-profit. If you're interested, I would love to answer any questions or schedule a call!

Looking forward to talking with you,
Bolun Thompson

EXAMPLE PITCH:

We aim to help the attendees feel that coding is fun and accessible. Think this: a teenager in San Diego believes that coding is something only elite techies do, but after creating an awesome app at Sandy Hacks, they feel inspired to go into the tech industry! Like Nanome, we hope to help the student attendees efficiently interact with our modern world using technology.
