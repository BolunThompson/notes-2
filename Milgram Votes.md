Mahiru:
	Ending:
		kidnapped him and he killed himself
		Manic and just realized he's dead (possibly killed him herself)
		He killed himself due to emotional trauma from her clingy behavior
Kazui: I barely understand the PV
	if it's neglecting wife, my answers
	I should rewatch it
Voice Drama's
	Amane:
		Self-rightous -- she belives that she's innocent, but that milgram is either rightor wrong
		Es finds her arguments logical, but annoying
			She doesn't realize the social circumstances of making the guard happy
	Mikoto: Yep, DID
		Although his non-agressive self is being tried and could not attack, who?

## Round 2
### Based on whether punishment is fair for their crime
All innocent, probably
### How they'll interpret it themself
: *sigh*, who needs principles. y'all are so dissapointing
Haruka
	Seems to be using Milgram to affirm his self worth
	Using Es, now Muu as a replacement for his mother's affection
	Guilty: He would think he's a bad person
		He might think his murders were bad, but still be liable to do them to other milgram participants
			On the other hand, Muu is his source of affection now, so it might not matter
		Ruin his self esteem though
		I don't think this would change his behavior? He still murdered before despite thinking it's wrong.
	Innocent: His self esteem would be affirmed and that he's a good person
		He would think his murders were fine
		He murders to increase his self esteem -- if it is high, he would not murder
	Truth table:
		Haruka | Muu
		GG : Kill himself?
			If not, lash out to gain affection?
		IG : Kill himself?
		GI : Lashing out to gain affection?
			But would he do this for Muu's affection?
		II : Nobody dies!
	Vote: Innocent
		Personal: Innocent bc being guilty wouldn't change his behavior and his self esteem is important
		Interpersonal: Innocent to prevent small chance of lashing out, but not important
		If he was prevented from murdering, still innocent bc I don't think guilty would change his behavior
	Actual: Guilty, GG
		Granted, it was a hard decision, and it could be for the best -- let's see!
		Let's hope he doesn't kill himself and doesn't lash out!
			And that he learns from his mistakes -- although i don't think he will.
Yuno:
	Drama: Self confident, belives that the world thinks that she's wrong and she doesn't care
		Doesn't like infantilization
		Almost like  Amane but more sympathetic?
			Didn't outright make demands from Es
			Accepts that the world thinks she is wrong and doesn't care
				Unlike Amane V1, who believed that she is right and the world is wrong
	Video: doesn't like infantilization
	Vote: *sigh*, innocent
		Personal: Guilty bc small chance of behavior change, but doesn't matter
		Interpersonal: Innocent bc they're less likely to be attacked later?
