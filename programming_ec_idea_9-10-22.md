goal: gain status from programming
ways:
    1 own projects literally rn
        problem: low chance--hardish to pivot to status
    2 voluteering for big open source:
        problem: hard, reqires lots of work and experience
    3 general open source:
        problem: path undefined to status
    4 extra osd type thing:
        problem: path semi  undefined, and what is known is social and hard (basically project management!)
    5 join community and find project within, then work -- basically startup
        problem: semi undefined, what is known is moderately uncertain
    6 freelance
        problem: boring, limited oppuirtunity for advancement

tangent: also think about blogging programmign
best: 1 w/ some ideas?, 2, 5

plan: adjusted 2
    get familar w/ rust by working on projects in it
        1 pl project
            read engineering a compiler doing so
        otherwise my own projects
            try to avoid pure toy projects (other than pl), but still do if necessary for learning
    join hack club and discord plt communities
