Is that the name of it?
How much am I willing to pay?
	Definitely $250, maybe more
		Depends on how much parents would pay vs myself
			(but honestly, they're probably going to pay for it all)
	Is that the right amount?
		How much is it worth it?
		I was willing to pay for HSNCT more, but
			1. Happy that I don't have to!
			2. That's a long term goal, not a one time event
		I'm willing to pay more to go to Champaign for the internship, but
			I feel that's worth more because it's education/career related
			It's also more important, and first dollars are easier to spend than second dollars
