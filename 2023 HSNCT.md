## Iternary:
- Buy from (health?) supermarket:
	- : Maybe buy Carry-on?
	- Vidalia onions
		- Maybe too big to keep in bag
	- Georgia Grinders https://georgiagrinders.com/
		- Can't bring it back with me to SAN bc of TSA
- Go to https://www.yelp.com/biz/souper-jenny-westside-atlanta for a lunch
	- Like 3 miles from Marquis
		- Maybe close enough to on 1.5 hours lunch break there?
			- If not, go on Friday or Monday
- College tour Georgia Tech
	- Can I and should I schedule something?
	- Can I just walk around campus
- After my flight, go to https://www.yelp.com/biz/jpresso-atlanta for coffee and breakfast
- Visit MLK Jr. Birthplace museum?
	- On path to Staplehouuse
- Eat at [Staplehouse Market](https://staplehouse.com) once?
	- 1.2 miles from hotel
	- chicken liver mousse tart according to [eater.com](https://atlanta.eater.com/maps/atlanta-iconic-dishes) is good
		- But do they still sell it? Is it too expensive?
NOT DOING:
	round1 in cumberland mall
	    probably has japanese games, but most likely not project diva
	    11 mile uber each way or metro + 45 minute bus -- is it worth the hastle?
IDEAS:
	> The hotel is downtown and within walking distance (10–15 minutes) of many of Atlanta’s major attractions, including the [Georgia Aquarium](http://www.georgiaaquarium.org/), the [High Museum](http://www.high.org/), [Centennial Olympic Park](http://www.centennialpark.com), the [World of Coca-Cola](http://www.worldofcoca-cola.com), the [National Center for Civil and Human Rights](https://www.civilandhumanrights.org/), and the [College Football Hall of Fame](https://www.cfbhall.com/).
TODO:
	What should I do after my flight but before hotel check-in starts?
	How to keep bag and wallet safe in Atlanta?
	Check whether they're an isolation tank available for me to try out
		And if it isn't too expensive ($80 dollars max?)
	Edit schedule to account for Ms. Eibeck
	Ask Ms. Eibeck how much unsupervised movement I can do 
		On the other hand, it would be good to chat with her over the trip

Jpresso -- close to the airport

	How to coordinate coffee with meeting Ms. Eibeck? 
		Maybe meet her there?
Gus's Fried Chicken
	4 stars on yelp, a tad expensive (16-20$), 1 block away from the hotel
# Takeaways
I'll have to buy a $25 cot for the room there
	If that fails, buy a sleeping bag from a local place
		Have to uber to a walmart lol and pay too much money, but it's possible
		Or perhaps ask for extra blankets and sleep on the floor
	Try to reserve a few days in advance to be safe?
		TODO: Call in APCS with John's booking number like a week before HSNCT
I need to bring a pack of masks
[Sleep guide](https://www.sleepinginairports.net/guides/atlanta-airport-guide.htm) for ATL
I need to bring my passport (airport ID, to be safe) and vaccination card (for HSNCT check-in)
	*Could* just bring photo of card, but not risking them not taking it
		I should also take a photo o
Is HSNCT recorded?
    Audio: yes, after the fact, probably
    Video: Only the later rounds we won't make it to 
## Ideas:
Use e-scooters to get around?
	Is it safe to use w/out a helmet and w/out experience?
## Packing
Try to bring 3 extra sets of clothes + laptop & charger + kitchen knife and sleep kit
	18 x 14 x 8
		The depth is the hardest part
			Maybe I could attach some small stuff to the top to optimize space?
	Pack tightly!
	Wear extra pair of socks and shirt to save space and warm myself up?
	Wear jacket, belt on the plane to save space
I need atleast 1 other set of clothes, underwear, and socks
	I could just wear extra shirts on the plane and reuse pants if necessary
