data taken around 7/18/22

magic number:
    conservative: 520 for a 4.8% chance per year for one of my parents to have bad covid-19
    optimistic: 1205 for a 4.8% chance per year
    average: 863
    plan: probably shutup until it's below 1000, start harassing between 1000- 520

The calculator I made: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/lnx0beg0eq
    inaccurasies:
    #necessary:
    assuming that mother and father would take paxlovid
    #worked on:
    assuming 52.7% household transmisability wth b.5 omicron:
        52.7% with b.1
        it is a wild guess
    assumigmg micro covid is accurate
    assuming no lowered reinfection risk, including death and long covid
    assuming most immune escape for vaccines
    #fixable:

    assuming long covid risk is actually accurate
    assuming initial long covid & sickness cost is negligible for my whole family
    assuming mother & father covid risk are equal
    assuming mother and father long covid risk are both equal to the 63 year old risk
    assuming bokei's actions don't effect me
    potential statistica errors

no booster:

20% reduction in non critical illness 
79% reduction in critical covid
40% reduction in non critical hospitalization

assuming 50% of non critcal vaccinated are actually asymptomatic

paxlovid hospitalization reduction in teenagers isn't significant IIRC (or similar) so I'm not counting it for me

chance of getting covid weekly = (cases per 100,000 / 100,000) * 10 * 100%
    10 is fairly conservative underreporting number
as of 7/18/22 it is 0.63%

assuming ba.5 has full imune escape
    ignoring the fact that ba.2 is dominant & that ba.5 has some neutralizing anti bodies
ignoring the fact that we're wearing kn95, which are at least a bit better than on average

52.7% chance of spreading B.1 Omicron covid to family members

sickness risk for me
    presumingly low given .63% chance catching it on normal mode weekly, & young, healthy, and low chance of hospitalization
immeadiate risk for me
    deaths is negligble
    1.47% chance of hospital admission if i get covid <-- averaging vaccinated and unvaccinated !! ; change
        9.26*10^-05 chance of me being getting covid and admitted
        not counting my risk-- probably lower b/c of good diet and exercise, despite anxiety and other health issues
long covid risk for me
    ((.63 / 100) * .012) = 7.56*10^-5 for moderate to severe long covid
    comparison: 0.11% chance of me dying in the next year for any reaon
    1.2% chance of me getting into a car accident yearly (20% discounted b/c father is a decent driver presumingly)
        conervatively: .33% chance of me getting moderate long covid yearly
            (1-((1-(.63 / 100)) ** 52)) *.012 * 100 = ...
immeadiate risk for family
    .34% chance of either parents getting hospitalized for covid per year 100*(1-(((1-(((1802/31066 )*.11) * (.63/100 * .8)))**2)**52)), assuming both are population level vaccinated
    .17% chance of father or mother getting hospitalized for covid per year 100*(1-(((1-((1802/31066 )*.11) * (.63/100 * .8)))**52))
    
long covid risk for family
    (1-((1-((1-((1-((.63 / 100) * .8)) ** 52)) *.042))**2)) * 100 = 2.21% per year


therefore:
    assuimng hospital & death is negligble for me and bokei
    .00756% chance of me getting moderate to severe long covid-- negligible
    chance of bad covid thing happening for family:
        (1-((1-(.34/100)) * (1-(2.21/100)))) * 100 = 2.54%
            so: assuming 

assuming 1/24 chance of long covid 12-16 weeks after covid:
