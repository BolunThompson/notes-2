	Personalized Invitations?
	    > One practice that has worked at some schools is to reach out individually to students who might be interested in quizbowl via a personalized email or letter inviting that student to attend quizbowl practices and/or join the quizbowl team. Teachers may ask other teachers for a list of students who seem particularly intellectually curious or who might be strong students but not currently involved in the quizbowl team and then send invitations to those students and/or their parents. This technique can help attract more students who might be interested in quizbowl, but wouldn't necessarily choose to attend practice on their own without this kind of direct encouragement.
