ideas:
	bus people up to la
	literally run it on tour buses
	Boat people to a channel island (or other island)
	Run hackathon camp -- bus people to a camp area for coding
		Like running a retreat
		: In hindsight, this is probably what the summer event is doing
			I think I found the idea on the slack -- did they find it to?
				Was it an HQ member posting the "idea" for interest testing?
	For project mangement
		Do 1 on 1 call with each interested participant
		Mandatory check-in calls weekly! Assign people tasks and make sure they get done!
	If busing:
		contact the local schools and local newspapers in the towns we go through
	Run it open source like angel hacks 3 or epoch?
		How succesful were they with attracting volunteers with that?
	Do email hit tracking and bulk emailing tools
		Compare different email versions
			Maybe need at least 7, perhaps up to 20 emails to compare versions?
				Are there other ways to do it taking advantage of gradual changes?
	Recruit for people on annoucements?
		On bronco newsletter?
	Look at CodeDay guide
	Email Oura lol!
	Try to get decent photography?
		: How professional do I need to get good photos?
		Get student volunteer?
			Send it out via NHS request
				On the other hand, kind of selective requirements lol
		Hire a service?
		Quickly learn how to get get phone photos and then do it?
	Ask about moving the hackathon forward a couple of hours to facilitate bussing?
		Or just the end to 11 to increase the length to 26 hours?
	Recconmend Megna to focus on something (and maybe other volunteers as well?)
		Maybe after the start bc the only work initially is sponsorship and venue?
	Partner with another organization to create a (probably themed) hackathon
		Like how horizon partnered with girl scouts
	Make a documentary of hack the wave?
		Is it worth bothering? Do people actually watch those?
			Maybe let somebody else make it as a project lol
	Maybe join wechat so i can do hack the wave advertising?
	Youtube adverts?
		Although @ian's reddit and instagram ads didn't work
	Biotech hackathon
		w/ igem?
		like biohacks in boston
	Swag:
		https://github.com/hackclub/assemble/blob/main/the-event/swag.md
		Give out small raspberry pico-esque things?
			Like that one buisneiss card guy? IIRC it was like 2-3$ per card, so it's doable
			NFC Cards instead?
				Use for voting?
			Use for a scavenger hunt, ctf, or arg?
	Are buisneiss centers suitable as venues?
		Contact whom? Owner or symphatehetic buisneiss?
	Should we offer transportation to improve accessilbility?
		How else to improve accesibility?
		From Carlsbad, downtown, irvine, Chula vista?
			Depending on where it is and interest
	Run a hackathon in hong kong later?
		@zrl has said before he might be reluctant due to political concerns
		ask opinion of hk people at outernet (if they exist) and/or sam poder?
People:
	Who has offered to help out
		: Ask slack about how to handle multiple volunteers and training
			Maybe start planing future 42 hr event now with extras?
			Maybe increase team size with increase specialization?
				If there is nothing better for them to do, throw them on the sponsorship team -- extra money will go to future events
				Eventually cut them off into a 42 hr event once there are too many?
		Nag Ediga -- participant
		Megna
		Shaunak
		Brianna's sister?
	Try to get 5 other people for the summer, assuming that 3 of them will help significantly
		1 from hack oc
		1 from sandyhacks organization
		1 from attendees
		2 from general interest and advertising
			At school
			On slack
			To clubs
			Steve? idk his status
		Try recruiting at club rush at start of next year for marketing work
Questions:
	How to dole out leadership positions?
		Multiple co-leaders, with me being one of them & "public face / last resort?"
		Maybe use "Head of spnsorshop, head of marketing, etc?"
	How can I recruit freshman and sophmores?
		: More willing to do plain volunteering perhaps?
		Talking to people I know, putting up poster, what else?
			If put up poster: put QR code with google form to fill out
				after form fill out I personal email them w/ additional info
	What other HS hackathons are in LA?
		Code Day, Hack Club, MLH, Unaffiliated
	Is my email bad? Is the chat GPT portion good or bad?
	Should I send (non personalized, probably) follow up emails?
		Can I automate it?
	Am I emailing the write person (head of marketing)?
		TODO: ask online in slack
		Should I email lower people in medium-large companies?
		Should I emai higher people in general or at large companies?
	How to dw Jonathan-esque situations at the event?
	After this event, how will organizing the next event be handled?
		And how will be pass on the torch to underclassmen?
	If we get out limited, small travel stipends, who should we give them to?
		Those w/ out access to hackathons ordinarily?
	Should we lower the age limit to middle schoolers?
		Rn the only MS students allowed would be 8th graders, which limits attendance (& value in emailing middle schools)
			Maybe add FAQ page about it? "Younger middle school students can come, but make sure they are mature"
			Can they stay overnight
	How to appeal to underpriveledged students?
TODO:
	Send more  venue emails
	Find more venues
		HQs
		maybe theatres and churches?
	Send more youtuber merch sponsorship emails
	Find in-kind prize sponsors?
Takeaways:
	Goal: 7 emails per day when I'm unoccupied with other hackathon work, so perhaps 3.5 a day average
	Try to specialize in something: sponsorship, marketing, or something else
	Say good luck to ian the day before hack OC
	Try to ask for bulk in-kind sponsorships
		bc more small prizes ?> few big prizes
Next steps:
	Go around and figure out how many people are interested in helping out
		if just 1: join the current team
		if 2+: start organizing a 42hr event with them for feb?
			Do I have time to do this?
	Start sponsorship emailing!
