Hello! To start things out, how comitted are all of you to helping out?
In other words: on a scale of 1 - 10+ hours a week, how much time are you willing to spend?

- Finding sponsors #1
- Design
- Event planning ??
- Marketing

If people who are interested don't have a task, more work will be available closer to the event



simple vision:

What is the problem?
What is the solution -- ie: the goal of the hackathon
-- basic information like date,  length, and lack of theme

problem: lack of oppurtunity for people to actually code, build projects, and meet people with a similar interest in our area
Solution: Our hackathon introducing people to coding where you actually make something with other people
Date: December 10th, subject to being postphoned
Length: 25 hours, unless I have a reason not to
Theme:  None -- just building, but I may change that completely or have an optional theme
