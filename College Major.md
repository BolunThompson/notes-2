First choices:
	Computer Science: Probably first choice
	Computer Engineering / EECS: Leaning against bc too hardware focused, hard to double major
		Same with Computer Science Engineering, despite that being more software
		If i can easily transfer to CS and this has a higher acceptance rate, apply to this
	Data Science: Maybe first choice? Gut feeling is that data science isn't interesting
		if good for machine learning, maybe pick this?
		TODO: look into if I like data science
		If it isn't impacted, mabybe second choice
Second Choice
	: best major for mathy cs like ml
	Math CS: Definitely second choice if an option
		In UCs, only UCSD and UCM offer this, so apply for UCSD
	Math vs Applied Math vs Statistics: Choose best for CS
	Math-Economics joint major: if an option, second choice maybe?
		Do I like Econ?
	Electrial Engineering: If I like hardware and it isn't impacted, consider?
		Although for hardware I would prefer CE, I think
	Physics
Questions:
	Computer Science vs Computer Engineering vs Computer Science and Engineering (ie: EECS)
	Is dual majoring a good idea?
		Would it help my employability or ability to do interesting, useful  work?
			Is there an over abundance of pure cs majors?
		What would I dual major in?
		Maybe instead of dual majoring, it would be best to, on my own, specialize in a non-cs area?
	Are my ECs and thus my acceptance rate more suited for CS than CE?
	Do I like computer engineering and hardware? Should I consider majoring in it?
		Would it be a good idea to major in ce or cs depending on whether the school isbetter at it or whether it's easier to get into?
			Also depends on if I can easily switch from ce to cs or vice versa
Takeaways:
	For scientific computing / HPC, I think I should major in CS since I'm more interested in the tech than the field
		If I majored in physics, I would be more focused on applying it to physics problems than HPC itself
			Although maybe that's a good thing
		Kind of restrictive since I might have to stay in academia
	Specific fields like HPC might bias me towards weird choices (ex: UCR as the best UC for it)
		Maybe email professors this summer if I'm interested to ask their advice?
