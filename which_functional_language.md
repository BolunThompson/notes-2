## Actively Using
Purescript: Front-end web development and other General devepment
    w/ halogen for component based development
    w/ htmx for simple backend development
    w/ hyperscript for simple dom manipulation ?
        may be unnecessary instead of just pure purescript
    3/6/23: getting a lil skepticalâ€š maybe ocaml || scala || clojure is a better solution
Rust: low-level development and when I need libraries for it

## Haskell vs Purescript
Haskell: Advanced types and language extensions, compiled to native, sometimes better libraries, lazy
Purescript: compiled to JS, JS interop, strict
I'll probably have a specific preference one day

## Perhaps to use in the future
Idris: If I want to use dependent typing and are willing to tolerate an immature language and libraries
Scala: If I need OOP or java interop
Clojure: If I ever need a lisp and am fine with or want dynamic typing
Ocaml: If I ever need an impure functional language
Haskell: If I need a pure functional language that compiles to native or has advanced extensions
Typescript: Good JS interop but still can be used functionally (eh maybe not)?
