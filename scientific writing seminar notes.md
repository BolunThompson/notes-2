4 Questions to design a paper:
	1. What is my purpose?
	2. Who is going to read it?
		1. What do they want to know?
		2. What do they already know and what do I need to explain?
		3. Where they might become confused?
	3. What is the *one thing* I want the reader to remember?
	4. What are the limits?
		1. Word count, how long the reader has to write it, how long you have to write it
Tell a good story
	Orient the reader with a solid introduction
	Emphasize what is new
	Use familar words for the reader
	Arrange the narrative with clear logic
	Provide clear, visually interesting figures
	Provide a good summary of key points
Avoids:
	Using chronological instead of analytical order
	Devoting the most ink to the parts that took the longest to do
	Including superflous information
	Omitting a discussion of assumptions or treatment of the data
	Failing to provide logical transitions	
Process:
	Start from a plan
		"Don't core dump"
		Why?
			1. Promotes thinking
			2. Easy to get started
			3. Gives your control over length and focus
			4. Allows you to structure the paper to be logically coherent
		Use the "resovoir system"
			By F. Peter Woodford *Scientific Writing for Graduate Students*
			Bin facts, ideas, illustrations, and logical connections
				Background & Refernces
				Materials & Methods
				Figures & Tables
				Results
				Discussion
			Zettelkaisen?
				Or plain obsidian notes?
			Write incrementally while you're doing the project
	Write a synopsis
		: Each step should be *one* coherent sentence
		1. What was the goal?
		2. How does it fit into the context of prior worlk?
		3. What methods did you use?
		4. What were your results?
		5. What do they mean? What have you contributed?
	Make an outline
		I. Background and Introduction
		II. Methods & Procedure
		III. Results
		IV. Discussion
		V. Conclusions
		: Write a sentence outline
			Example: "Deep saline aquifiers (DSAs) are undergrounds salt resoivoirs that store permeable rocks"
			Make your sentences as specific and quantitive as possible
				If you have closely related sentences, remove one or combine them
			Make sure your sentences have a linear relationship
		: Try inverted pyramid broad to specific
			from background to what we specifically did and concluded
	Proofread
		: in this order
		
Paragraph format -- like State, Explain, Exlemify, summarize
	Topic sentence
	Explain
	Give an example
	Summarize that leads logically to the topic sentence in the next paragraph
