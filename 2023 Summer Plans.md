## Travel
Amtrak:
	$500 US pass for ten rides
		Can't use it on flexible tickets -- I would have to book early so that's not the only option
	I might be able to time it such that I spend a day touristing one of my stops
		Take an Amtrak train up to LA or Chicago and tour there?
Champaign:
	Take Amtrak train to Champaign (and perhaps back) (total $420)
		Last train could be either Chicago → Champaign or Galesburg → (bus) Champaign
Albany:
	Options:
		Take a train from Champaign to Albany and then back to San Diego ($610)
		Fly into Albany from SD ($550)
		Fly into NYC then take the train up to Albany (or whereever I need to go) ($490)
