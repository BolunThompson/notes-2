goal: gain status from programming
ways:
    1 own projects literally rn
        problem: low chance--hardish to pivot to status
    2 voluteering for big open source:
        problem: hard, reqires lots of work and experience
    3 general open source:
        problem: path undefined to status
    4 extra osd type thing:
        problem: path semi  undefined, and what is known is social and hard (basically project management!)
    5 join community and find project within, then work -- basically startup
        problem: semi undefined, what is known is moderately uncertain
    6 freelance
        problem: boring, limited oppuirtunity for advancement

tangent: also think about blogging programmign
best: 1 w/ some ideas?, 2, 5

plan: adjusted 2
    0. learn rust properly
        maybe also w/ other low level stuff
    1. get familar w/ rust by working on projects in it
        1 pl project
            read engineering a compiler doing so
        otherwise my own projects
            try to avoid pure toy projects (other than pl), but still do if necessary for learning
        also maybe read example of good rust code to learn?
    2. learn llvn / type theory / more plt / etc anythign else necessary
    3. simultaneasly learn rust compiler by reading code and docs
    3.1. start contributing (to rust, could also pivot to other project)
    also: join hack club and discord plt communities
