Questions and Takeaways
	Are zones just cells?
		TODO: Ask
		I think? 
	Question: Why can't you export enzo-e datasets similarly to flash/gamer script
		Is it to do with the weird block list (string list, unswizzled) or something else?
		: You can, that was my script last year
		 Why is my Enzo-E to octree script so complex compartively?\
	Why did we need to change it so that nzones can be a non power of 2 when it's just octrees, which have to divide in powers of 2?
		Maybe because there can be an arbritary amount of individial cells at the lowest level?
MT TODO:
    read script and test it to make sure that it is properly loading the enzo-e dataset into octs
	    (with pos of both or something)
	    Figure out why it needs + 1000 octs and, if possible, fix
	    See testing guide paper
	Read and understand my old script
	Read old material from last year, if available
		Emails!
    Review what each script does -- both mine and mt's -- and record
Paperwork TODO
	Email signed form and get background check info
	403b after I'm employed
	Email about my orientation after I'm employed
	After orientatation, email about travel plans (sigh)
