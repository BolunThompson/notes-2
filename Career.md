As for idea that "easier to teach an x major to code than teach a coder x, " should that decide my major?
	Example: learn chemistry then go into something with ML with it
After college apps are over, explore fields to see if i want to make them my career
	Distributed computing
		Maybe specifically cluster computing
			Attend the 2024 IEEE Cluster Conference and apply for their student mentoring program, if that still exists?
	Simulation / Scientific Computing / HPC work like my internship
I:
	want to work on hard problems
		Ex:
			Academia
			Industry Research
			Reseach Engineer
			Quant
			Some software engineering
				There's a fine line between boring, unimpactful work and genuingy interesting work
	don't want to do unimpactful work
		Ex: building crud app #1324
		["Avoid the api mines"](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rt8i7n/i_got_a_degree_for_this/)
To work on hard, interesting problems, a graduate degree might honestly be the best option
	Escapes me from standard SWE work

Question:
	What major for it?: See [[College Major]]
	What path should I try to take for it?
Options:
	CS degree -> Systems
	CE degree -> Hardware
	CS and subskill, or field degree and subskill -> Application
		The computational science route
		Path: (computational?) physics → PhD → Research Engineer making big money
		Field degree path would be to work on scientific software then transition into research in that field with scientific software or industry with the skills i built up (probably the latter)
			HPC, distributed computing?
			Computer graphics
				Spooky thing is that it could get me into film or game dev, which I want to avoid
		Subskill in career or grad school
		Field degree might honestly be easier -- it's more direct into the work
		Applied math vs Physics vs Some subdiscipline therein
QUESTION: If I major in physics or applied math, could I use that degree to work on hard, interesting, technical problems with programming, and would it be more efficient than a CS degree (and maybe PhD)?
	On the otherhand, post physics PhD software engineer career path doesn't seem that good...
		But vs post CS degree technical work?
	Like this? https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6kjjob/software_engineering_opportunities_in_the/djmo9gh/
	Or this? https://www.simplyhired.com/job/x4NE2K1vUAyZjXvVZEBn7hW4hA76FHtTlQ6DbSOvOocOZ24aK_hIYg
	It's hard to compare -- only anecdotes
Maybe just pick based on what is best for the school?
Technical jobs:
	Embedded
	Research
	Backend Gaming
QUESTION:
	Of the 3 career options, which is best?
		Leaning toward Physics/applications.
			Seems more likely to do real, interesting work than Systems/CS
			Not interested enough in Hardware/CE
	If I do a physics PhD, what are my eventual path? Which are these are likely or reasonable?
		: What are the chances that I can't do one?
		Data Science
		HPC Work
		Researcher
		Scientific Software worker?
			Simulation work?
		Quant
	Vs applied Math degree?
	Physics PhD vs CS PhD competiveness
		About the same
	How should I change my college list?
		Up UPenn and Penn State?
		Check US News
What about CC?
	Leaning toward no if vs Riverside bc less research opportunities
		Although it's *definitely* not impossible to do it as a cc, or to transfer and do it then
Type of job I like: https://www.indeed.com/q-Cuda-Engineer-jobs.html?vjk=3e7ec22b82498670
Similar situation: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/jf658k/does_it_make_sense_to_do_a_phd_if_you_dont_want/
Current plan for computational physics / scientific software:
	Apply to College -> Learn as muchL C++, Fortran, Matlab, parallelizing code, Data Structures & other relavant CS topics, etc before I go to college with projects to demonstrate my knowledge -> Do good undergraduate research in college -> Good grad school -> Good computational science job
