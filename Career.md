As for idea that "easier to teach an x major to code than teach a coder x, " should that decide my major?
	Example: learn chemistry then go into something with ML with it
After college apps are over, explore fields to see if i want to make them my career
	Distributed computing
		Maybe specifically cluster computing
			Attend the 2024 IEEE Cluster Conference and apply for their student mentoring program, if that still exists?
	Simulation / Scientific Computing / HPC work like my internship
I:
	want to work on hard problems
		Ex:
			Academia
			Industry Research
			Reseach Engineer
			Quant
			Some software engineering
				There's a fine line between boring, unimpactful work and genuingy interesting work
	don't want to do unimpactful work
		Ex: building crud app #1324
To work on hard, interesting problems, a graduate degree might honestly be the best option
	Escapes me from standard SWE work

Question:
	What major for it?
		CS, because it's more direct. Although there's a good chance I'll still have to subskill into an application, no matter what I learn the basic skills.
			Although physics and doing the opposite is still tempting
			I either subskill, or I do hardware or theory
	What path should I try to take for it?
Options:
	CS degree -> Theory
	CE degree -> Hardware
	CS and subskill, or field degree and subskill -> Application
