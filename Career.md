As for idea that "easier to teach an x major to code than teach a coder x, " should that decide my major?
	Example: learn chemistry then go into something with ML with it
After college apps are over, explore fields to see if i want to make them my career
	Distributed computing
		Maybe specifically cluster computing
			Attend the 2024 IEEE Cluster Conference and apply for their student mentoring program, if that still exists?
	Simulation / Scientific Computing / HPC work like my internship
