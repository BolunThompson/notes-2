	Timeline: https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/g4znlw/attention_juniors_heres_a_college_essay_timeline/
	I think there's a guide somewhere about how officers review essays -- look at that?
		Referenced on one of the reddit links the general guide has
	Maybe others
Beeminder reading, writing, and editing believe essays
	Merge into college essay goal later?
	Try to read/write these before or after morning SM
		Maybe get bokei to edit one to figure out where to focus on?
	Try to listen to some on runs
	TODO: Are I believe essays like PIQs and supplementals?
		Probably, I think? I need to check
Write 1-2 essays per week until complete (still following suggestions on guides)
	Maybe start in June?
	If I have too many essays, write two per week
		Especially short supplementals
	I could take some weeks off as a break or to enter in ECs
	Focus on a school for a few essays and then go onto the next one
	Figure out what personally traits and other aspects of myself I should show in each essay
	There is the issue that I would like to write essays about things I do during the summer
		However, it isn't 100% a problem because I don't have to
			Even if I write about organizing sandy hacks, i could just write about it and then briefly talk about organizing hack the wave at the end
Intermittently spend a week to review a certain essay or two
	UCI, UCLA in the past have offered PIQ advising sessions -- go to these if still available
		Any free specific programs for this seperate from the uni?
	Get people to edit my essays?
		: Aim for two per essay, maybe 3 for my uc app and personal statement
		: TODO: Look online for who you should get to edit your college app essays for each, and do that
		Mrs. Montegomery
		Mrs. Winn?
		Mother
		Father
		Bokei
		Friends
