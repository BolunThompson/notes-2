 I should attempt to join communities for the things I do
    try to do it in a more personal way:
        lurking → forums → twitter → discord → in-person
    why: oppertunities could come out
    ex: already in QB community, could be running a tournament
    to join:
        hackathon, programming : hack club
        mega diva : sega genesis homebrewing community
        functional programming: functional programming community?
            a bit vague, maybe join web dev or lang dev communities?
    how can I browse them?
        on break time, simpler perhaps?
        rss into sm?
Social media to use for it:
	Discord
	Slack
	IRC?
	Forums
