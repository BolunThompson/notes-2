Ideal front-end markup language:
	Ideal for writing: [textile](textile-lang.com) looks really nice for writing HTML
		Also [AsciiDoc](asciidoc.org) â€” seems to be more powerful, although it doesn't have some features of textile (no cite element, unfortunately)
	Ideal for templating: HAML? Slim? a similar system?
    JSX: When I need react or need both templating and writing (although maybe slim-lang would work with that too)
    MDX: Same, probably better than JSX if it had better editor support
    mdx
        would be better if it had more markdown support and better semantic support
            I would probably just not bother w/ new projects and just use HTML or something with components
    for simple templating [haml](haml.info) looks nice
	    much more conside than HTML
	    the problem is that it's not suited / is confusing for multiline text constants and complex templates
		    I would need to try it first though
[11ty](https://www.11ty.dev) seems like a nice simple static site generator
