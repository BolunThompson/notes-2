too focused on visual things
	ex: websites, not plt or functional programming or type theory
scrapbook is like screaming into the void, so I don't like it
	I'm fine with just creating my projects & posting them on github & doing a final realease, not screaming my accomplishments into the void as I create it
Travel stipends:
	Hard problem
	Issue for 44 74 compared to assemble:
		they don't have enough money to give stipends to all attendees
		they don't like to make it like more college apps, like it is rn
			Not like Zephyr!
			Granted, it's usually like moderately competitive (50%?) college apps I think?
	Doesn't really effect me -- I can just wait and see how much money they'll give me!
		I'm a dedicated member, so unless it's 100% need based I will probably get something
			(and if it is need based I still might get something)
	My hesitant solution:
		Increased stipends for dedicated members (like me!)
		Either a percentage of cost to go or stepped & low enough that most people will have to pay a small amount ($50?) to go
			Make sure only people who really want to go go
		Not need based, hesitantly, but allow appeals for lower income people
			Might increase complexity though?
